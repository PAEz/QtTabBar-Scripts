Flatten Selected Folders

This will copy the contents of all selected folders into the current folder and delete the folder if afterwards its empty.
 
I have a habit of putting everything my mates drop off in new folders so I can keep track of where I and others are up to.
Eventually I sort all the files out and its a bit of a pain going in them all, this fixes that.
