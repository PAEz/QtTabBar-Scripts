PATH

This allows you to add or remove the path of the first selected item to the USER : PATH enviroment variable.
If the path isnt already there it will offer to add it and remove if it does exsist.
If it exists in the SYSTEM namespace then it will tell you it exists but you wont be able to remove it due to permissions.
